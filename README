libgrapheme
===========

The libgrapheme library provides functions to properly handle Unicode
strings according to the Unicode specification. Unicode strings are made
up of user-perceived characters (so-called "grapheme clusters") that are
made up of one or more Unicode codepoints, which in turn are encoded in
one or more bytes in an encoding like UTF-8.

Despite the complicated multilevel structure of Unicode strings,
libgrapheme provides methods to work with them at the byte-level (i.e.
UTF-8 ‘char’ arrays) while also providing codepoint-level methods.

See libgrapheme(7) to get started and try out the self-contained examples
given on the manual pages for each function.

Requirements
------------
A C99-compiler and POSIX make.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (usually not necessary, the
default prefix is /usr/local).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install libgrapheme
(if necessary as root):

	make install

Usage
-----
Include the header grapheme.h in your code and link against libgrapheme
with "-lgrapheme" either statically ("-static") or dynamically.
