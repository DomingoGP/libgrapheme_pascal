.Sh NAME
.Nm grapheme_utf8_decode
.Nd decode first codepoint in UTF-8-encoded string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In grapheme.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn grapheme_utf8_decode "const char *str" "size_t len" "uint_least32_t *cp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn grapheme_utf8_decode
function decodes the next codepoint in the UTF-8-encoded string
.Va str
of length
.Va len .
If the UTF-8-sequence is invalid (overlong encoding, unexpected byte,
string ends unexpectedly, empty string, etc.) the decoding is stopped
at the last processed byte and the decoded codepoint set to
.Dv GRAPHEME_INVALID_CODE_POINT.
.Pp
If
.Va cp
is not
.Dv NULL
the decoded codepoint is stored in the memory pointed to by
.Va cp .
.Pp
Given NUL has a unique 1 byte representation, it is safe to operate on
NUL-terminated strings by setting
.Va len
to
.Dv (size_t)-1
and terminating when
.Va cp
is 0 (see
.Sx EXAMPLES
for an example).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn grapheme_utf8_decode
function returns the number of processed bytes and 0 if
.Va str
is
.Dv NULL
or
.Va len
is 0.
If the string ends unexpectedly in a multibyte sequence, the desired
length (that is larger than
.Va len )
is returned.
